# Bank_customer_churn
Using various classification algorithms in Machine learning a customer is classified in two classes in order to obtain customer churn of the bank.
Initial Exploratory data anlysis is performed on the data set. 
Classification Algorithms like Logistic regression (univariate, bi-variate and multi-variate), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest are used for analysis. 
Ensemble model is created using stacking. 
Finally metrics of all the models are compared and ROC AUC curves are plotted for visualization in order to find the best possible model for classification
